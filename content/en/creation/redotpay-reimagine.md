[**RedotPay**](https://www.redotpay.com/) is a leading stablecoin payment platform — "Where Crypto Meets Real Life." Backed by top-tier investors including Lightspeed, Accel, and Coinbase, it serves millions of users across 180+ countries with crypto cards, multi-currency wallets, swaps, and P2P trading.

RedotPay's business is undeniably successful, with rapid user growth and a strong product-market fit. However, from a product design perspective, the overall experience feels **fragmented** — inconsistent visual styles, mismatched icons, uncoordinated color usage, and cluttered layouts create friction that undermines an otherwise powerful product.

This is my unsolicited redesign concept for RedotPay, built entirely through **Vibe Coding**. It reimagines the core mobile experience with four key design principles:

### 1. Brand-First: Elevate "Redot"

RedotPay should foreground its "Redot" brand identity. The signature red should run through the entire product as a consistent thread — from the primary CTA buttons to accent highlights — making the brand instantly recognizable at every touchpoint.

### 2. Visual Consistency

Every element — icons, typography, spacing, color palette — must speak the same design language. A unified visual system eliminates the patchwork feeling and builds trust through polish.

### 3. Clean & Focused

Less is more. The redesign strips away visual clutter, prioritizes content hierarchy, and gives each screen room to breathe. Users should immediately understand what to do and where to go.

### 4. Delightful Interactions

A great fintech product shouldn't just function — it should feel *smart*. Try swapping currencies on the home screen to see the animated transition, or tap the red button on the third tab to experience the "Pay with Redot" motion design. These micro-interactions are what transform a utility into a product people *love* to use.

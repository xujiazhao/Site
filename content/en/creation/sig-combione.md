CombiONE is an aseptic carton packaging solution designed for [**SIG**](https://www.sig.biz/en). My team focused on designing new die-cut lines and packaging openings for them. The project involved user research, packaging design, graphic design, and product design.

SIG is one of the world's leading providers of food and beverage carton filling solutions. In the spring of 2019, SIG came to ArtCenter College of Design to sponsor this project. All deliverables were first submitted to them for review and, after the confidentiality period, I was permitted to showcase them in my portfolio.

## SIG's Requirements ##

| Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tethered Cap | According to European law, all food and beverage packaging must feature tethered caps to prevent littering and environmental pollution. |
| Shipping Efficiency | SIG has a joke about "shipping air" — meaning there are large gaps between individual packaging units during transport. They wanted to minimize these gaps through design changes to improve shipping efficiency. |
| Production Feasibility | All die-cut lines must be closed, and production must be achieved through folding rather than cutting openings. |
| Multi-Pack Solution | SIG also wanted us to design multi-pack solutions for large families, filling a gap in their current product line. |
| Grip Experience | SIG also wanted us to prioritize the ergonomic grip of the packaging, especially considering the experience of elderly users. |

## Research ##

First, we conducted an in-depth study of SIG's existing product offerings to better understand their market positioning and competitive strengths and weaknesses.

We then researched and analyzed several key topics related to the packaging industry and produced a report covering: smart packaging, industry trends, CMF, sustainability, and multi-pack solutions. This report served as a professional knowledge handbook on the packaging industry, helping us clarify our subsequent design direction.

## Design ##

![](/assets/images/sig-combione/sig-combione-sig_mockup.webp)

We brainstormed hundreds of concepts for different potential user groups. Through continuous paper folding and prototyping, we validated the production feasibility of each concept. This iterative process continued for 4 weeks until we arrived at satisfactory solutions.

We also created user personas such as Uber drivers and flight attendants to define the functional positioning of each design. Overall, however, the ultimate goal of our solutions was to serve all users in their daily lives, rather than being limited to any specific user type.

## Solutions ##

### CombiGrip + CombiSlide ###

CombiGrip + CombiSlide is a medium-sized beverage packaging design.

Thanks to our newly designed die-cut lines and folding structure, CombiGrip provides an optimal grip, helping the elderly, children, and especially Parkinson's patients better hold the package while pouring.

CombiSlide features a slide-open spout with a nearly negligible height profile, significantly reducing wasted space caused by stacking during transport.

### CombiMax + CombiPull ###

CombiMax + CombiPull is a large-capacity beverage packaging set designed for big families.

CombiMax features an indentation on the front that allows the spout to sit flush with the body when not pulled open, thereby avoiding wasted space during transport.

CombiPull works like a standard water bottle cap — twist to unlock, then pull to break the seal.

### CombiPack + CombiAlways ###

CombiPack + CombiAlways is a multi-pack packaging solution.

CombiPack uses a single sheet of cardboard as a carrier basket for the four individual packages inside.

CombiAlways is compatible with both standard flip-top caps and CombiTime tethered caps.

### CombiMeal + CombiZip ###

CombiMeal + CombiZip is a compact, portable food packaging solution.

The zipper closure has two layers: an inner aluminum seal that is broken upon first use, and an outer resealable zipper.

This solution can be used for microwaveable ready meals or takeout products.

### CombiPalm + CombiSip ###

CombiSqueeze + CombiPaste is a packaging solution for jelly/butter-type products.

CombiSqueeze can store two different types of jelly simultaneously, allowing users to enjoy both at once.

Twist the CombiPaste spout to open the package, then twist it back to reseal.

### CombiStack + CombiTime ###

CombiStack + CombiTime is a small packaging solution with excellent stackability.

CombiStack has an indentation on the bottom, allowing individual units to stack neatly on top of one another.

CombiTime uses an ultra-thin plastic tether to connect the cap to the body, significantly reducing production costs.

## Field Testing ##

We applied 365 Everyday Value® branding to the final prototypes and brought them to a local supermarket, placing them on real shelves to validate the designs in an actual retail environment.

Imagine opening Copilot — and instead of reading, you simply press play and start listening to a podcast. A podcast generated from the content you care about, personalized to your interests, and available anytime, anywhere. That's **Copilot Podcast**.

### How It Works

By leveraging podcast generation technology, we transform partners' text-based news content into engaging, conversational audio streams. Inside Copilot, a dedicated podcast page offers an **endless, personalized podcast stream**.

- Each topic links back to its source article for deeper reading
- Users can skip topics they don't like — Copilot updates the playlist based on their preferences
- The stream is limitless — listen during a commute, a workout, or any idle moment

This dramatically increases Copilot session duration and opens up monetization opportunities through contextual advertisements between segments.

### Behind the Scenes

At the core is podcast generation AI that doesn't just convert text to speech — it creates a real podcast experience:

- **Multiple formats** — single-host monologue, two-person dialogue, or three-person casual conversation
- **Voice customization** — partners can clone and customize host voices to match their brand identity
- **Dynamic playlists** — Copilot generates personalized feeds based on each user's interests

This encourages partners to bring more content into the podcast format, expanding the content ecosystem while redefining how users consume information through Copilot.

### Vision

Copilot Podcast is not just a new listening experience — it's a scalable platform powered by generative AI, bridging the gap between text-based content production and audio-first consumption.

## Proof of Concept

This is a fully functional demo that converts any RSS news feed into a natural, conversational podcast in real time. It uses a TTS model with custom-cloned voice profiles to produce organic dialogue — the conversations sound authentic, and the content is sourced directly from real news articles.

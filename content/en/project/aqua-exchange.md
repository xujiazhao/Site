AQUA Exchange is a mobile-first social derivatives app built on [**Hyperliquid**](https://hyperliquid.xyz/) that turns complex on-chain trading into simple, one-tap decisions. As the co-founder and design lead, I am responsible for the end-to-end product design — from branding and visual identity to interaction design and front-end implementation via vibe coding.

## Vision

The derivatives market is massive, yet on-chain trading remains inaccessible to most people due to complex workflows, intimidating interfaces, and steep learning curves. AQUA was created to bridge this gap — making on-chain perpetual trading **easy to start** and **easy to use** for everyone.

## What We Offer

### Access All Markets

One-click access to on-chain derivatives across Hyperliquid/HIP-3 — crypto, tokenized stocks, metals, gaming assets and more. AQUA aggregates diverse markets into a single, unified trading experience.

### Decision-Simplifying

Native social & AI features — including celebrity follow/inverse trading and agent strategies — reduce decision friction and turn discovery into action. Users don't need to be experts; they can leverage the wisdom of top traders and AI-powered strategies.

### Secure & Convenient

Mobile-first design with fiat on-ramps and a social-login, no-mnemonic wallet for secure, low-friction trading. Users can get started without dealing with seed phrases or complex wallet setups.

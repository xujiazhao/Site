# Copilot Content Ecosystem

> **End to end content experience for AI**
> 

The **Copilot Content Ecosystem** encompasses the products involved in Microsoft's process of acquiring and distributing content—including articles, videos, podcasts, and galleries—that is accessible to our customers. 

The Ecosystem partners with more than **20,000 global media organizations** daily to deliver news, finance, sports, and lifestyle content in multiple languages across various sectors. This content integrates into Microsoft's global distribution system and powers user products like **Windows, Copilot, Bing, MSN, and Edge New Tab Page**, providing personalized information experiences for hundreds of millions of users. I am responsible for designing both the user-facing and media partner experiences, covering the entire content supply and distribution chain.

### Consumer-facing Content Distribution and Experience Design

Once high-quality content is integrated into Microsoft’s ecosystem, it is intelligently distributed across various consumer-facing products.

I am responsible for the **News, Finance, and Weather** experiences within **Copilot**, focusing on balancing two key modes — the **AI conversational experience** and the **content browsing experience**.

Throughout the design process, I addressed several key challenges:

- **Information Architecture Integration** – Unified the component system and visual language across modules such as News, Stocks, and Weather, creating a cohesive and multimodal content experience.
- **AI Conversation and Content Fusion** – Explored how AI can assist users in reading, summarizing, and extending content within Copilot’s conversational and generative contexts.
- **Design System Evolution** – As a business designer, I frequently collaborated with the headquarters team to align with the latest experience standards, while distilling insights from my own domain to feed back into Copilot’s foundational experience and design system.

When designing Copilot, one of the key challenges was finding the right balance between conversational interactions and content presentation.

Typically, users approach Copilot with expectations similar to traditional AI tools such as ChatGPT or Gemini. However, like other players in the industry, Microsoft is actively expanding AI into broader usage scenarios.

I am also responsible for the design of the MSN Finance product.
Compared with Copilot, the MSN interface features higher information density and a more compact layout. This difference stems from the distinct user mindsets between the two products: Copilot users tend to browse content casually and check stocks occasionally, while MSN Finance targets semi-professional users, where information completeness takes priority over reading comfort.

### Partner-facing Content Platform and Ecosystem: MSN Partner Hub

On the content supply side, Microsoft provides a unified creation and data management platform — MSN Partner Hub — for global content partners such as CNN, BBC, and others.

I am responsible for the end-to-end design of this platform, including its information architecture, design system, and data experience. The platform offers partners a comprehensive suite of tools and services, including:

- Content synchronization and editing tools
- Performance and traffic analytics
- Audience growth and revenue monitoring
- Account and brand management

I am also working on introducing AI-assisted creation features — such as an AI writing assistant and content optimization tools — to help partners improve both the efficiency and quality of their content production.

Within this project, we place particular emphasis on copyright protection and AI hallucination risk control, ensuring that the integration of AI enhances productivity without compromising partner interests or content authenticity.

Also, I am responsible for maintaining the platform’s design system and collaborating closely with the front-end development team to ensure visual consistency and high design fidelity.
Recently, I led a major upgrade of the platform’s visual system, focusing on:

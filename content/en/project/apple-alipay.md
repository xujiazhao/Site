> **Build the best purchasing experience at AppStore**
> 

In the Greater China area, Alipay had built a strong relationship with Apple’s service, which includes the payment account in AppStore, members platform within AntGroup subordinary or invested wallets, like Alipay, AlipayHK, GCash, and so on.

I was in charge of continuously improving the binding flow of Alipay at AppStore:

Alipay was Apple’s first partner eWallet in Greater China. In 2016, Alipay established a platform called Apple Zone for all the bound users to manage their transaction history & subscription on the eWallet end. It is also a great interface for Alipay to attract more users to bind Alipay on AppStore. On it, users can claim benefits like coupons for AppStore, free trials for Apple Music, and iCloud. Collects members’ credits for trading more benefits. Apple Zone had become the most important tool for Ant to compete with WeChat on Apple-related business.

I took over this project in 2022. With my team’s efforts, we successfully convinced Apple to use MiniProgram to host the Zone. It was the first time Apple accepted media like MiniProgram. In this version of the Zone, I had redesigned the zone to have a much stronger Apple feeling. The new design looks much younger and suits youth. In this project, I communicated with Apples WW MarCom a lot to sell my design. Though there were some arguments between the two teams, we had finally convinced them that we understand Chinese users and their sense of aesthetics better than Apple.

Now Apple-related business is the largest revenue source of Ant International BG. Alipay has approximately 7 million bound users, and Apple Zone has about 1.3 million DAU.

> **Pay beyond borders**
> 

Alipay+ is a global payment network by Ant Group. It connects merchants and customers all over the world, lets users pay with any partnered wallets at any partnered merchants. In a simple way, compared to Visa or MasterCard, Alipay+ is a smarter and much more digitized “Wallet Group”. Alipay+ is now the most important international product at Ant Group.

My main job at Alipay+ is building its three payment products. Based on my understanding of payment and Ant Group’s experience, added with monitoring of data like PSR and frequent product usability testing, I continuously build and improve the payment experience of Alipay+.

- Online Payment
- Offline Payment
- Auto Debit

I created a UX self-evaluating chart to design a better user experience for payment product, see: [UX self-evaluate chart for payment product](/en/writing/ux-self-evaluate-chart-for-payment-product)

In addition, I designed the Product Intro part of the official [Alipay+](https://www.alipayplus.com/) site.

As a payment network provider, it builds partnerships with Acquirers and Wallets. It rarely has direct connections to end users (including Customers and Merchants). So if Alipay+ wants to reach the end users and maintain its consistent experience, Alipay+ uses doc to host its product, design & integration guidance. And provide related backend services to its partners. So Alipay+ provides not only an easy-to-use Customer end product but also provides efficient and productive Business/Developer end product. Designing an okay checkout page is simple, but helping dozens of acquiring partners and hundreds of merchant build payment experiences that meet Alipay+’s consistency & standardization is extremely difficult.

Thus, I also define Alipay+ UX standards and guidance and manage part of the design work of Ant Intl Doc Platform to maintain Alipay+’s related product offerings.

# Microsoft


I joined Microsoft Studio 8 design team in 2023, initially responsible for designing content products for [**Bing News**](/en/project/bing-news) and **MSN**, covering core experiences in news, finance, and video. As the AI era began in 2023, I participated in the design of several Microsoft AI products, including [**Copilot Content (News / Finance / Weather)**](/en/project/copilot-content-ecosystem), **Bing Chat**, and the intelligent financial assistant **Money Assistant**.

Starting in 2024, I took full ownership of the [**MSN Partner Hub**](/en/project/copilot-content-ecosystem) product design — Microsoft’s global content ecosystem platform serving partners such as **CNN**, **BBC**, and various mid- to small-sized MCNs. I led the design system for partner management, optimized the growth experience across the ecosystem, and facilitated the integration between Copilot and Partner Hub.

Within the team, I play two key roles:

- **Firefighter**: Rapidly responding to high-pressure projects and driving complex issues to execution.
- **Creative Contributor**: Actively participating in brainstorms and generating innovative design concepts across diverse initiatives.

In addition, I’m a core member of the **Studio 8 MarCom (Marketing Communications)** team, responsible for:

- Internal and external brand communications and visual content for the Microsoft Design team;
- Visual design for annual events and team celebrations;
- Leading and executing the **Studio 8 Rebranding Project**.

I also contributed to the **Studio 8 × Peking University joint course**, exploring collaboration between design education and industry practice.

In my daily work, I actively use the **Vibecoding tool** to empower designers with greater autonomy in implementation, enabling independent project execution and advancing the vision of **“Design as Productivity.”**

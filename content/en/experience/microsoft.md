I joined Microsoft Studio 8 design team in 2023, initially responsible for designing content products for [**Bing News**](/en/project/bing-news) and **MSN**, covering core experiences in news, finance, and video. As the AI era began in 2023, I participated in the design of several Microsoft AI products, including [**Copilot Content (News / Finance / Weather)**](/en/project/copilot-content-ecosystem), **Bing Chat**, and the intelligent financial assistant **Money Assistant**.

Starting in 2024, I took full ownership of the [**MSN Partner Hub**](/en/project/copilot-content-ecosystem) product design — Microsoft’s global content ecosystem platform serving partners such as **CNN**, **BBC**, and various mid- to small-sized MCNs. I led the design system for partner management, optimized the growth experience across the ecosystem, and facilitated the integration between Copilot and Partner Hub.

In the second half of 2025, building on my deep experience across both the B2B and consumer sides of Microsoft's content ecosystem, I initiated and drove the [**Copilot Podcast**](/en/creation/copilot-podcast) project — bringing podcast capabilities into Copilot. As the **DRI (Directly Responsible Individual)**, I led a cross-functional team of 1 PM, 3 engineers, and several external contributors, reporting directly to the **Copilot CVP**. This role sharpened my skills in cross-team coordination, roadmap ownership, and end-to-end product leadership.

Beyond project leadership, I also serve as a responsive firefighter on high-pressure initiatives and an active creative contributor across the team's brainstorms and design explorations.

In addition, I’m a core member of the **Studio 8 MarCom (Marketing Communications)** team, responsible for:

- Internal and external brand communications and visual content for the Microsoft Design team;
- Visual design for annual events and team celebrations;
- Leading and executing the **Studio 8 Rebranding Project**.

I also contributed to the **Studio 8 × Peking University joint course**, exploring collaboration between design education and industry practice.

In my daily work, I actively use the **Vibecoding tool** to empower designers with greater autonomy in implementation, enabling independent project execution and advancing the vision of **“Design as Productivity.”**

BJMUN is a non-profit organization that holds educational activities like Model United Nations conferences for high school and college students in Beijing. Started in 2010, BJMUN has already held over 200 activities, speeches, and discussions that benefited over 10 thousand participants (person-time). It is one of the largest and oldest organizers of [Model United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/mun) in China.

In 2013, I joined BJMUN as an average delegate when I was in my 10th grade. Starting from then, I gradually changed my role from a participant to a leader and planner. After 8 years, I now work as a part-time adviser for the current BJMUN student team, helping them solve all the issues regards to legal, finance, and public relationship.

**Education is a field that requires long-period and continuous input.** To keep bringing meaningful and insightful contents to the students, I closely follow social trends and international situations. It is also a field that follows general rules of market behaviors. I keep pushing the organization to generate new activities and topics to attract more schools and students.

In the meantime, I lead digitization and modernization for the organization. We used to use the most traditional tools like Excel and Emailing to run the enrollment process. After my contribution for the past few years, we now have a CRM system and Content Distribution platform to connect with our participants. I am also one of the major contributors to creating BJMUN related contents like organization operation guidelines and working handbooks for the [BJMUN knowledge repository](https://www.yuque.com/bjmun-public).

The satisfaction of working at BJMUN is seeing the happy faces and grateful post my participants share on social media. And as I am ageing old, I can still stay connected to these young souls through BJMUN. **Talking and sharing the experience with them makes me feel younger and more energetic. I am not only an exporter but an importer at BJMUN. These young minds always help me find new ideas and insights for innovation.**

Someday in the future, I may have my own startup making educational product. BJMUN will definitely become a valuable resource for me to study the market, users, and trends.

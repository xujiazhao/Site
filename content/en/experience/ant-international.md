# Ant International


> **Master a little of the Payment**
> 

In 2020, I joined the Ant Intl Design team as an intern and got a return offer. I officially join the team in 2021 as a full-time designer. Ant was a distinguished company, that helped me build a deep understanding of the FinTech. With that, I developed a complete comprehension of Payment. Special thanks to the team and my leader, I grew significantly as a professional UX designer. Devoting all to my work, I won the “Outstanding Newcomer” of Ant Group Design team in earlier 2022. Accompanied by the growth of the business, I am capable of not only designing good product experience but also driving the business to success.

Other than other Ant BGs or Alipay in Hangzhou, the Ant Intl BG in Shanghai works on Ant and Alibaba’s international business. My responsibility is mainly working on payment-related products and products that are affiliated with business in between Alipay and Apple.

Projects I’ve been work on:

- [Alipay+](/en/project/alipay)
- [**Apple ✕ Alipay**](/en/project/apple-alipay)
- [Ant Intl Doc Platform](https://www.notion.so/Ant-Intl-Doc-Platform-c236c15f690c4cbda5a5897ddb2e8db4?pvs=21)
- Taobao & Tmall’s payment in SEA, Taiwan, Hongkong, and Macao
- Alipay for Global Business

Besides the work for business, I also put effort into other areas and worked as an excellent team player. I used to promote Figma at Ant Design Team, to save my colleagues from Sketch’s glitches and crashes as well as enhance our productivity. Through after Figma banned DJI’s account, it is hard to widely deploy Figma inner Ant. I can still promote other Chinese tools inside Ant. I was the first person outreaching out to MasterGo at Ant, and we already started its usability testing within Alibaba & Ant.

I also participate in other activities such as commonweal and broadcasting. I am glad to share my ideas with the public. During the 2022 U Design Week, I volunteered as one of the organizers as well as a translator for VIPs.

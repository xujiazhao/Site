# INSEAD Business School


> **Teaching design at the best business school in the world.**
> 

After the 4 months of exchange at INSEAD, I was invited by Professor Manuel Sosa to be a part-time faculty for its Design Thinking and Creativity for Business (DTCB) online program at INSEAD. As a design coach, I help program participants solve their business challenges using design methodology. I had over a hundred students from all over the world in the past year. It gave me chances to talk to many non-design executives with different backgrounds.

The projects I helped with majored in four topics:

- Internal structure and work-flow;
- Product/Service improvement;
- Market Expansion;
- Career development.

It was exciting to work with all my students. Seeing issues from the outside as a design thinker enables me to provide the most unbiased advice to them. Most of the time, my students are new and unfamiliar with the design thinking methodology. So I introduce the basic process of 3 “i” of design, the insighting, ideating, and iterating to them with the following toolkit.

As a young designer, I was lucky to chat with these high-level managers in different industries. I started the job in 2020, and it was soul-stirring to hear so many stories all over the world. In my 100+ students, I had a 60-year-old gentleman who lost his job during the COVID-19 trying to rebuild his competitiveness in the talent market. I had a work-mum working hard even her daughter was infected. And I had CEOs fighting for their employees to keep the business running. 2020 was tough, but we were all putting effort into building a better world, a better company, a better self.

Based on the research of the existing product line/the market/users and my internship experience from the Xiaomi eco-system department. I tried to understand that what is the reason that Xiaomi is so successful today, what is the inner logic of its product line, what are the pros and cons of its current situation, and if applied, what are the improvements that could happen to it.

### **Xiaomi's Current Product Line**

Currently, Xiaomi has one leading smart home brand: Mi Home, and other affiliated brands under the eco-system like Zhimi, Yunmi. This big family produces more than 200 different products, including smart appliances, customer electronics, furniture, accessories, and outdoor products.

It is phenomenal how many companies and products that Xiaomi has invested in. When I worked there, I was shocked by the workload was assigned to each designer. Its business model was straightforward: **the management team in Xiaomi will look for valuable technology providers (like start-up companies), they will invest the team with resources within the eco-system environment. One of the most critical resources is the eco-system design crew.** So, it is like the opposite of outsourcing the design while holding the technology. Xiaomi “outsources” the technology work while managing an agile design team.

Pro of Xiaomi’s eco-system environment:

- **Adequate Design** – Generally speaking, Xiaomi’s products have clean and intelligible designs, which attracts a lot of young customers.
- **Flexible Buying Options** – Ex. You can find at least 6 different smart door lock on Xiaomi’s website.
- **Short R&D period** – The technologies are handy. Xiaomi needs only to figure out the adaptability for the tech in the design. It usually takes three months in Xiaomi to launch a new product.

Con of Xiaomi’s eco-system environment:

- **Poor Design Consistency** – There is no consistent design language in the Xiaomi eco-system.
- **Overwhelmed Customers** – Options are good, but they overwhelmed the customer quickly.
- **Fragmented Experience** – Most of the products are connected with a smartphone. However, the user experience to set up a new product in the Mi Home app is very complicated. Also, the App development is separated from the hardware development, which results in an inconsistent experience on the user end.

### **Xiaomi's Challenge**

What does the future of the Xiaomi Smart Home eco-system look like?

- Does Xiaomi need a new brand?
- Does Xiaomi need to simplify the product line?
- Which type of company should Xiaomi cooperate with to expand the market?
- Who should be the target user for this improved design?
- What is an ideal digital experience for the new system?
- … …

### What should Xiaomi provides

**Indubitable Trust**

Trust is the basis for business expansion. U Home should impress the user with strong confidence while using our product, and build the trust after.

**Faithful Caring**

U Home cares about the customer like a family. Our functions and services are designed based on the users’ most need from daily lives at home.

**Life-technology Harmony**

Technology is a must for IoT-connected devices, however, we need to find the balance point between tech and live in order to not push away the majority user group.

**Positive Lifestyle**

U Home’s goal is to provide the motivation to a positive lifestyle for its users. Helping them to have a healthier, more sustainable life.

**Universal Accessibility**

U Home Product should be accessible for anybody both price-wise and purchasing-wise. Customers should be able to find a suitable U Home Device at an affordable price.

**Heartening Happiness**

Home supposed to be a place of happiness and laugh. U Home wants to create endless of them.

### Xiaomi’s role model

**Microsoft - design language**

I consider Microsoft as a role model for U Home on the detailing. Its aesthetic characteristic on the Surface series is very powerful.

**Steelcase - environment language**

I consider Steelcase as a role model for U Home on the general environment feeling. Its color, shape, atmosphere work well together.
